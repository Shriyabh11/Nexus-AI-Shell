## 🎯 Vision

Imagine talking to your computer like you would to a system administrator:

```bash
$ nexus "show me what's making my computer slow"
$ nexus "find all Python files I modified yesterday"
$ nexus "which customers bought the most products this month?"
$ nexus "is my database running efficiently?"
```
